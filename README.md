# Silmarillion Pdf Pl
 
 
The *Silmarillion* summaries were a project that I undertook beginning in January 2006 as part of a guided reading of *The Silmarillion*. My goal was to describe the major events and key players of each book or chapter, cutting the extraneous names and material that often proves problematic for new readers. Christopher Tolkien himself admits that *The Silmarillion* is a challenging work, in the Foreword to *The Book of Lost Tales I,* yet *The Silmarillion* is--at least in my opinion--a rich work that is well worth the effort for fans of Tolkien's work.

Following the culmination of the reading, many wrote me to say that they found the summaries helpful in illuminating the key ideas of *The Silmarillion*. While the summaries were written for and are probably best suited for first-time readers or readers who have found the book challenging, I hope that they will also be a handy reference to veteran *Silmarillion* fans as an easy means to recall the major events of any particular section of the book.
 
I am making my summaries publicly available in hopes that they will be used by Tolkien fans reading *The Silmarillion* for the first time or groups leading readings of the book. Therefore, summaries are freely available for posting online, reprinting, or distributing as needed for non-profit purposes. When credit is given, it should be given to Dawn Felagund with www.silmarillionwritersguild.org listed as my contact.
